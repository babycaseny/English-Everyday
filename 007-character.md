Character is an important part of any story, because it can push the story forward and make audience read more devotedly. More precisely, if a story don't have any character, it will not be a story. I always reading and writing, that's why I understand the important of character in story.

In order to design a character, you should ask yourself two questions :

1. What is the role of the character in story?

2. What is the aims of the character in story?

For example, when you are writing a horror story, you may need a character who can push the story forward by enter a haunted house. If the character is a coward, he/she may not go there, and the story will not be move foward. So you should design a character who are brave, otherwise he/she should have a fair reason to enter the haunted house, such as forced by bully.

Also the aims of character is important too. A character may kill some people in order to earn money, or begin an adventure in order to save his wife -- it is a power of character to action in the story, even if he/she may not finish the target at the end of story. 

That's why I say you should ask the aims of the character in story before you design it.
