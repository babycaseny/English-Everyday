My name is Sardo, a system administrator assistant of Nxtomo Games.

I like programming, even though I am not a professional programmer. I have other projects on github, such as S3Backuper and Capture For Plurk. They are writing in node.js and python, which are my familiar programming languages. 

These projects are already completed. If you are interested in them, please take a look at my github pages.

Moreover, I like writing too. Everyday, I write at lease 200 words for my fiction(please search "novel vs fiction" and tell me the difference), and put it on my blog for everyone. Although I may not a good writer, I still like writing as it makes me happy, and I hope people will feel happy after reading my fiction too.

I also like reading, that is why I bought an amazon kindle, and use it to reading books. Recently, I am reading Night on the Galactic Railroad of Kenji Miyazawa, and Galileo of Tono Keigo. I like these authors, so I have bought other books which wrote by them too. 

(There's no relationship with the paragraphs above. Do not use "Finally") I hope we can be friends. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me by email or twitter.
