When I am free, I may playing video game to kill time.

There are many video game consoles at my home, such as SS, PS2, PS4, XBOX360 and 3DS. Also,I had installed some games in my computer too.

Today, I will talk about one of my favorite games: Kantai Collection, which is a web game released by DMM.

It is a strategy game which let you organize your own fleet and fight with monsters, but all of the battleships are not objects. They are some girls who called "Kanmusume", and have power to fight with their enemys: "Shinkai shinkai".

In this game, player need to  bring up Kanmusume, make them strong, organizing fleet and combat the enemies, then retake the sea area which had been occupy by enemies.

The gameplay of this game is not very nice, but I still enjoy it because of good character design, try not to use the same patten so much). Kanmusume is  not only look cute and pretty, but also cultured, it let them look like real people, not just a game character.  

When they grow up and be strong, I will feel very happy as they are my children. That's why I like this game. 

I hope more people will fall in love with this game.

So, what's your favorite game? please feel free to tell me.
