When I am free, I may playing video game to kill time.

There are many video game consoles at my home, such as SS, PS2, PS4, XBOX360 and 3DS. Moreover, I had installed some games in my computer too.

Today, let's talk about one of my favorite games: Kantai Collection, which is a web game released by DMM.

It is a strategy game which let you organization your own fleet and fight with monster, but all of the battleships are not an object. They are some girls who called "Kanmusume", and have power to fight with their enemy: "Shinkai shinkai".

In this game, player's target is bring up Kanmusume, let them be strong, organization fleet and combat the enemies, then retake the sea area which had been occupy by enemies.

The gameplay of this game is not very nice, but I still enjoy it as the design of game characters is good. Kanmusume not only look cute and pretty, but also cultured, it let them look like a real people, not just a game character.  

When they are grow up and be strong, I will feel very happy -- as they are my children. That's why I like this game too. 

I hope more people will fall in love with this game.

So, what's your favorite game? please feel free to tell me.
