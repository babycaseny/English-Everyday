When I am free, I may [playing] -> (may + (verb)) video game to kill time.

There are many video game consoles at my home, such as SS, PS2, PS4, XBOX360 and 3DS. [Moreover,] (no more "moreover" please, try other words and study the usage of "moreover") I had installed some games in my computer too.

Today, [let's] -> (let's === let us, but you are only one person) talk about one of my favorite games: Kantai Collection, which is a web game released by DMM.

It is a strategy game which let you [organization] -> (pronoun + verb!) your own fleet and fight with monsters, but all of the battleships are not [an object] -> (singular or plural?). They are some girls who called "Kanmusume", and have power to fight with their [enemy] -> (singular or plural?): "Shinkai shinkai".

In this game, player's target is [bring up] -> ("is" is a verb, verb + noun) Kanmusume, let them be strong (make them strong), [organization] -> (organizing) fleet and combat the enemies, then retake the sea area which had been occupy by enemies.

The gameplay of this game is not very nice, but I still enjoy it [as the design of game characters is good] -> ("because of good character design/settings", try not to use the same patten so much). Kanmusume (a verb is missing) not only look cute and pretty, but also cultured, it let them look like a real people (people is plural, why use "a"?), not just a game character.  

When they are [grow] (tense!) up and be strong, I will feel very happy as they are my children. That's why I like this game [too] (why too?). 

I hope more people will fall in love with this game.

So, what's your favorite game? please feel free to tell me.
