My name is Sardo, a system administrator assistant of Nxtomo Games.

I like programming, even if I am not a vocational programmer. I am have other projects on github, such as S3Backuper and Capture For Plurk. They are writing by node.js and python, which are my famous programming languages. 

These project are already completed, if you are interested, you can visit my github page to find them.

Moreover, I like writing too. Everyday, I will write at lease 200 words for my novel, and put it on my blog for everyone to read. Although I may not a good writer, I still like writing as it can let me feel happy, and I hope people can feel happy after reading my novel too.

I also like reading, that is why I buy an amazon kindle, and use it to reading book. Recently, I am reading Night on the Galactic Railroad of Kenji Miyazawa, and Galileo of Tono Keigo. I like these author, so I have other book which wrote by them too. 

Finally, I hope we can be a friend. If you read this article and be interested, please feel free to contact me with email or twitter.
