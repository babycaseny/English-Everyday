I have many SNS(Social Network Site) account, such as facebook, twitter and plurk, and login them everyday.

My facebook is for my friends who in the real world, homemates and colleague to contact me, and I only share my photo and some intresting news on there.

I like twitter more than facebook, as my homemates and real world friends will not see my post on there. I can speak out freely, do not need to worry about many problem -- for example, if I talk about things of my boy friend (or girl friend) on twiiter, my homemates and real world friends will not know it. It's very important for me.

However, my favorite SNS is plurk, as I have many internet friend on there. Most of my internet friends are native, but there are many taiwan peoples on there too. 

They are so friendly, always care and help me when I having difficulty. I am extremely grateful to them, so I always help them too, such as help them to build a website, or let them to use my VPN server.

Although real world friends is important, online frineds is significant to me too. Do you think so?
