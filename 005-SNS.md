I have many SNS(Social Network Site) account, such as facebook, twitter and plurk, and login (log in/on, "login/logon" is noun) everyday.

My facebook ("My facebook account", "facebook" is owned by a rich guy called Mark Zuckerberg http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) is for my friends ("whois is in", or no "who") in the real world, homemates (again, please don't call your family "homemates"...) and colleague to contact me, and I only share my photo and some intresting news on there.

I like twitter more than facebook, as my homemates and real world friends will not see my post on there. I can speak out freely, do not need to worry about(without being worried about) many problems -- for example, if I talk about things of my boy friend (or girl friend) on twiiter, my homemates and real world friends will not know it. It's very important for me.

However, my favorite SNS is plurk, as I have many internet friend(friends) on there. Most of my internet friends are native, but there are many taiwan peoples (Taiwanese) on there too. 

They are so friendly and caring that they usually help me for the difficulties. I am extremely (absolutely) grateful to them, so I always help them too, such as help them to build a website (building websites), or let them to use my VPN server.

Although real world friends is(are) important, online frineds is(are) significant to me too. Do you think so?
