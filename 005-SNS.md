I have many SNS(Social Network Site) account, such as facebook, twitter and plurk, and log in everyday.

My facebook account is for my friends who is in the real world, family and colleague to contact me, and I only share my photo and some intresting news on there.

I like twitter more than facebook, as my homemates and real world friends will not see my post on there. I can speak out freely, without being worried about many problems -- for example, if I talk about things of my boy friend (or girl friend) on twiiter, my homemates and real world friends will not know it. It's very important for me.

However, my favorite SNS is plurk, as I have many internet friends on there. Most of my internet friends are native, but there are many taiwanese on there too. 

They are so friendly and caring that they usually help me for the difficulties. I am absolutely grateful to them, so I always help them too, such as help them to building websites, or let them to use my VPN server.

Although real world friends are important, online frineds are significant to me too. Do you think so?
