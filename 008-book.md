Today, I will talk about my favorite book -- Durarara.

It is a Japanese light fiction series which written by Ryohgo Narita. The story of this book is about a boy who called Mikado Ryugamine moves from rural area to a big city -- Ikebukuro, then acquaint with many strange people or monster such as Shizuo Heiwajima and the headless rider.

The type of this fiction is modern fantasy, which is  my favorite story type. That's one of the reasons why I like it, and the character design is attraction to me too. 

All of character in this story is abnormal, such as Mikado Ryugamine is the founder of a color gang which called "Dollars", and long his life can be abnormal morbidly. It's make him done a lot of terrible thing,
and hurt his friends.

It sound like amazing, but it is one of the attraction of this story. It make all of the character impressive, so reader will be diffcult to forget them, and read more devotedly. That's why in order to make my own fiction be remarkable, I always refer this book. 

If you like modern fantasy, I think you will like this book too.
