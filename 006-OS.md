Nowadays, there are two popular modern operating systems for PC: Windows and OSX. Although there are many engineers using Linux (GNU/Linux, not replated to English, but the concept.) on their PC, most people only using Windows or OSX.

In my case, I had installed Windows and Linux on my old computer, but now I am using Windows and OSX on the new computer (iMac). 

I like OSX because of (the, you need a determiner for singular nouns) good user interface design. It (is, a verb is very important) not only beautiful, but also easy to use. For example, After replace(we need a noun after "after") the old computer to iMac, I learn (using) OSX in one day without help. 

In contrast to OSX, I spend at least one week's time ("one week", one week is already time. you don't say "2 dallor's money") on learning Linux and Windows. That's why I say OSX is easy to use -- I don't need to waste too much time on learning.

Howeveri(stop using "however" before you learn how to use it correctly.), although my favourite operating systems is OSX, Windows and Linux is still important for me. I need Windows when I want to playing ("to play", http://paper.wenweipo.com/2008/01/22/ED0801220012.htm) games, and I must using (use) Linux on my work.

These operating systems cannot replace each other. Never.
