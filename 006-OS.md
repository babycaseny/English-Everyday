Nowadays, there are two popular modern operating systems for PC: Windows and OSX. Although there are many engineers using Linux on their PC, most people only using Windows or OSX.

In my case, I had installed Windows and Linux on my old computer, but now I am using Windows and OSX on the new computer (iMac). 

I like OSX because of good user interface design. It not only beautiful, but also easy to use. For example, After replace the old computer to iMac, I learn OSX in one day without help. 

In contrast to OSX, I spend at least one week's time on learning Linux and Windows. That's why I say OSX is easy to use -- I don't need to waste too much time on learning.

However, although my favourite operating systems is OSX, Windows and Linux is still important for me. I need Windows when I want to playing games, and I must using Linux on my work.

These operating systems cannot replace each other. Never.
