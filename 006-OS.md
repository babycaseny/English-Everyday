Nowadays, there are two popular modern operating systems for PC: Windows and OSX. Although there are many engineers using GNU/Linux, not replated to on their PC, most people only using Windows or OSX.

In my case, I had installed Windows and GNU/Linux on my old computer, but now I am using Windows and OSX on iMac. 

I like OSX because of the good user interface design. It is not only beautiful, but also easy to use. For example, After Ireplace the old computer to iMac, I learn using OSX in one day without help. 

In contrast to OSX, I spend at least one week on learning Linux and Windows. That's why I say OSX is easy to use -- I don't need to waste too much time on learning.

Although my favourite operating systems is OSX, Windows and Linux is still important for me. I need Windows when I want to playing to play games, and I must use GNU/Linux on my work.

These operating systems cannot replace each other. Never.
