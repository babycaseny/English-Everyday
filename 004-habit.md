Today, let's talk about my habit.

Rise (Rising) early can makes people energetic, so I wake up at 7:00 a.m everyday. However, as I am always busy of (busy with) my works, I can't sleep early (Always after 12:00 am).

I know it is bad for my health, my homemates (don't call your family "homemates...") and
superiors always told me "You must sleep early." too. 

In order to change this habit, now I am trying to improve my works effciency. (Now I am trying toe improve my work effciency in order to change this habit.) If I can finish the works(try using different words to express the same thing such as "tasks") earlier, I will be allow to (1. be allowed to. 2. Using "allow" is too serious in this case... try some others...) sleep earlier too. 

So when I working (work) at home, I will not browse facebook and plurk, just(only) let my line and telegram be online, as friends or colleague may want to talk about some important things with me on these SMS software (on these messaging channels).

After changing my habit, I think I will not feel tried when I am working, and my works effciency and quality will be improve (be improved) too. It's very important, as system administrator (a system administrator) must work carefully.

I hope I can change myself!
