Today, let's talk about my habit.

Rise early can makes people energetic, so I wake up at 7:00 a.m everyday. However, as I am always busy of my works, I can't sleep early (Alway after 12:00 am).

I know it is bad for my health, my homemates and
superiors always told me "You must sleep early." too. 

In order to change this habit, now I am trying to improve my works effciency. If I can finish the works earlier, I will be allow to sleep earlier too. 

So when I working at home, I will not browse facebook and plurk, just let my line and telegram be online, as friends or colleague may want to talk about some important things with me on these SMS software.

After changing my habit, I think I will not feel tried when I am working, and my works effciency and quality will be improve too. It's very important, as system administrator must work carefully.

I hope I can change myself!
