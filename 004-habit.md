Today, let's talk about my habit.

Rising early can makes people energetic, so I wake up at 7:00 a.m everyday. However, as I am always busy with my works, I can't sleep early (Always after 12:00 am).

I know it is bad for my health, my family and
superiors always told me "You must sleep early." too. 

In order to change this habit, now I am trying to improve my works effciency. (Now I am trying toe improve my work effciency in order to change this habit.) If I can finish the tasks earlier, I will be able to sleep earlier too. 

So when I work at home, I will not browse facebook and plurk, just only let my line and telegram be online, as friends or colleague may want to talk about some important things with me on these messaging channels.

After changing my habit, I think I will not feel tried when I am working, and my works effciency and quality will be improved too. It's very important, as a system administrator must work carefully.

I hope I can change myself!
