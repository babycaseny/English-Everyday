Good communication skills will help you work more efficiently, as it can let you understand the colleagues and  situations well. and enables us to resolve differences. How do we improve it? Writing.

Writing is a good way (search "method or way") to training the communication skills. It is because you need to organize your thinking, then write it orderly. 

Moreover, if you want to write a good article, you should read more and think more first. After that, you will be more knowledgeable, which is good for you too.

No matter what you write, it is still useful. For exmaple, you can share your views through articles, or stories. After that, you will feel happy, and your communication skills will be improved.

That's why I keep writing fictions everyday. It is not only let readers be happy, but also good for me.

Although writing an article or fiction is not easy, I hope I can keep this habit forever.

Let's write together, shall we?
